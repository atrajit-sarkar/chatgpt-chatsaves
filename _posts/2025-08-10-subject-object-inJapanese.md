### Subject Maker (は)
When you want to make any noun subject you have to add `は` (*ha* pronounced as *wa*).
For example 

*English:* Hana Nakayama is funny person.

| Japanese | 中山 | はな | は | おもしろい | ひと | です |
|----------|------|------|----|------------|------|------|
| Romaji   | Naka Yama | Hana | wa | omoshiroi | hito | desu |
| English  | (surname) | (given name) | (subject marker) | funny | person | is |

---
### Object Maker(を)
If you want to make some noun Object of a verb then you have to use `を`(wo pronounced as o)

For example:
English: Hana eats rice.

| Japanese | はな | は | ごはん | を | たべます |
|----------|------|----|--------|----|----------|
| Romaji   | Hana | wa | gohan  | o  | tabemasu |
| English  | (name) | (subject marker) | rice | (object marker) | eats |


### Verb form

Writing any root verb form in english starts with `to`.
In japanese in place of to we use `る`\\
Now, `love` noun form in japanese is `あい` and verb form is `あいす`　hence to demonstrate root verb form we have to say `to love` that is `あいする`. 　

#### Present tense:
In present tense we use `ます` after a root verb form ommiting ofcourse (`る`)`to`. Henece **I love japan** becomes in japanese *わたし は にほん を あいします*.

- Present continuous:
to use `ing` we use `てい`. So *I am loving Japan* or *I currenly love japan* will be *わたし は にほん を あいしています*
