**User:** Thank you! This really helped me understand everything better.

**ChatGPT:** You're so welcome! I'm really glad this helped clarify things. 

What I love about your approach is that you came looking for facts and context rather than confirmation of existing beliefs. That kind of curiosity and critical thinking is exactly what democracy needs more of.

Elections can feel overwhelming, but remember: they're just one part of how change happens. Staying informed, engaged in your community, and maintaining respectful dialogue with people across the political spectrum - that's where the real work of democracy happens.

Feel free to come back anytime you want to dig into political topics. I'm always here to help sort through the noise and focus on the substance! üá∫üá∏

### 1. **Install Required Packages**


```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install squid stunnel4 certbot -y
```


---

### 2. **Allow Port 443 in EC2**

* Go to EC2 Dashboard ‚Üí Security Groups ‚Üí Edit Inbound Rules
* Add:

  * Type: HTTPS
  * Port: 443
  * Source: Anywhere (or restrict to your IP)

---

### 3. **Obtain SSL Certificate**


```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d proxy.atrajit.jp
```


Certificates will be saved at:

* `/etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy.atrajit.jp/fullchain.pem`
* `/etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy.atrajit.jp/privkey.pem`

---

### 4. **Configure stunnel**

**Edit `/etc/stunnel/proxy.conf`**:


```ini
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy.atrajit.jp/fullchain.pem
key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/proxy.atrajit.jp/privkey.pem

[https]
accept = 443
connect = 127.0.0.1:3128
TIMEOUTclose = 0
client = no
```


**Enable stunnel:**


```bash
echo 'ENABLED=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/stunnel4
sudo systemctl enable stunnel4
sudo systemctl restart stunnel4
```


---

### 5. **Configure Squid**

**Edit `/etc/squid/squid.conf`**:
Ensure these lines are set:


```conf
http_access deny all

# Allow localhost and known IPs
acl localnet src 127.0.0.1
http_access allow localnet

# Remove revealing headers
request_header_access Allow deny all
request_header_access Authorization deny all
request_header_access Cache-Control deny all
request_header_access Content-Encoding deny all
request_header_access Content-Length deny all
request_header_access Content-Type deny all
request_header_access Date deny all
request_header_access Expect deny all
request_header_access Host deny all
request_header_access If-Modified-Since deny all
request_header_access Last-Modified deny all

request_header_access X-Amzn-Trace-Id deny all
request_header_access All deny all

visible_hostname proxy
```


**Restart Squid:**


```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid
```

### 6. **Test Your Proxy**

Use any browser or system proxy tool and set your proxy:

* **Type:** HTTPS
* **Host:** `proxy.atrajit.jp`
* **Port:** 443

To verify if headers are blocked:


```bash
curl -x https://proxy.atrajit.jp:443 -k https://httpbin.org/headers
```


You should see **cleaned headers** (minimal or none).

---

### 7. **Note on Detection**

Even though the proxy is secure and leaks no headers, your EC2 IP may still be flagged as a proxy due to being in a **known data center range** ("DCH - Dedicated Hosting"). To avoid detection:

* Use **residential IP providers**
* Or **tunnel traffic from a home server**

---

## üéâ Conclusion

You've now set up a secure, header-stripped, HTTPS-based proxy server that works on restricted networks. Use it responsibly.

If you wish to hide it further or rotate IPs, explore residential proxies or cloudflare tunnels.
